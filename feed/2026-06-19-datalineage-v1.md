# Clarified location requirements for lineage streaming

**Date:** 2026-06-19  
**API:** `datalineage.v1`  
**Impact:** Low  

## Summary

A documentation update for the Data Lineage API clarifies that the locations field in streaming search requests must include the location specified in the parent field.

## Details

The GoogleCloudDatacatalogLineageV1SearchLineageStreamingRequest schema now explicitly states that the locations array must contain the location provided in the parent field. While this is a documentation-only change, it highlights a specific validation requirement for developers using the SearchLineageStreaming method to ensure their request parameters are consistent.
