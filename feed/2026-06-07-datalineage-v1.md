# Clarified location requirements for lineage streaming

**Date:** 2026-06-07  
**API:** `datalineage.v1`  
**Impact:** Low  

## Summary

A documentation update clarifies that the locations list in streaming search requests must include the location specified in the parent field.

## Details

The GoogleCloudDatacatalogLineageV1SearchLineageStreamingRequest schema now explicitly states that the locations array must contain the location provided in the parent field. While this is a documentation-only change, it highlights a strict validation requirement for developers using the streaming search functionality to avoid potential request errors.
